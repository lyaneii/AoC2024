### Introduction
One of the few things I look out for every year, _(this is my second year \*but I truly am excited for it\*)_, is 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄!\
Besides the fun and whimsical nature of the challenges I see it as a great opportunity to learn a new language.
Last year I tried my best in C but unfortunately I fell off after day 11. 😔\
I had only been programming for about 2 months at the time, so I am incredibly proud of my progress and not to mention the [⭐⭐ gold stars](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/766670621869735958/1312889512791249006/image.png?ex=674e2324&is=674cd1a4&hm=2389554d4817a7d0d24c657f5455201a84cc467c2fc9b2b4e76b28ae26baba07&) that I got on all of them!

This year I have built up a lot more knowledge and confidence to try it again, but no, not in C.\
Since I would like to do something in graphics I have decided to take on the challenge of learning a relevant language, C#.\
Now I am a VSCode user, I have never used any other IDE before so this was not as easy as I thought..\
So after an hour of chaos, trying to figure out Visual Studio and setting up the environment I ended up switching to Rider and it turned out just fine. 😂\
Now I am ready to take on the Advent of Code and hopefully finish the entirety of the challenges this time!
